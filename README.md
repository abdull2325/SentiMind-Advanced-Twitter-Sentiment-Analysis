# 🎭 SentiMind: Advanced Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## 🌟 Introduction
Welcome to SentiMind, a sophisticated sentiment analysis tool designed to decode the emotional undercurrents of Twitter! This project harnesses the power of machine learning to classify tweets as positive or negative, offering insights into public opinion and emotional trends.

## 🚀 Features
- 📊 Balances dataset for fair analysis
- 🧹 Advanced text preprocessing with NLTK
- 🎨 Beautiful visualizations with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and WordCloud
- 🧠 Machine learning model using Logistic Regression
- ⚡ Multiprocessing for faster data handling
- 🔮 Interactive sentiment prediction for custom text input

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages
3. Download NLTK data:


##Visualisation
SentiMind generates several insightful visualizations:
- Sentiment Distribution
- Word Clouds for Positive and Negative Sentiments
- Confusion Matrix
- Feature Importance

Check out the `images/` directory after running the script!

## 🧠 How It Works
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Efficiently loads and cleans the Twitter data.
2. **Text Vectorization**: Converts text to numerical format for model training.
3. **Model Training**: Uses Logistic Regression to learn sentiment patterns.
4. **Evaluation**: Assesses model performance with classification reports and visualizations.
5. **Prediction**: Allows real-time sentiment prediction on new text inputs.

## 🎯 Model Performance
Check the console output for detailed classification reports and accuracy scores.
